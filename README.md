## Data Preparation & Cleaning
Before creating the visuals, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accurate analysis:
- **Quantity Check:** Excluded records where `Quantity < 1` (negative or invalid entries).
- **Unit Price Check:** Excluded records where `Unit Price < 0`.  
- Data transformation methods and conditional logic were applied to filter out bad data.
